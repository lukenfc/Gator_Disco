Senior project for Computer Engineering capstone course at UF. Touch Screen synthesizer currently in development to be deployed on a rasberry pi. Will allow the user to create and perform their own sounds using a touch screen and external MIDI keyboard, as well as upload sounds to an external web server to be shared with other users to use on their own machine.
